to get specific Field's data while query  (phm 76-2) 

---> like  , 
const user = {
	name: "Nishad",
	age:21,
	country: "Bangladesh",
	isStudent: "yes",
	Religion : "Islam"
}

const cursor = userCollection.find({}).project({name: 1, age: 1, isStudent: 0})

cursor = { name: "Nishad", age: 21 } 

 !!!!!  (isStudent is Missing cz we use 0 for)
